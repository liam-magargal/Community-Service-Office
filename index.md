# Our Mission
"To provide students, faculty and staff of Lehigh University a readily accessible doorway through which they can explore the rewards and benefits of providing service to the community," ([Lehigh University](https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/content/about-us-our-mission-staff-contact-us)).

# What We Do
The Lehigh University Community Service Office coordinates a wide array of events in the Bethlehem Community. We coordinate everything from weekly trips to prepare a meal for the residents of Victory House, a local shelter for veterans in transition, to Spooktacular and Spring Fling, massive events where we invite families from Bethlehem to Lehigh's campus for a day of crafts and activities led by various different Lehigh University clubs and organizations. I find the work to be incredibly meaningful and rewarding. I have not only used my abilities to make positive changes, but I have learned vast amounts about my community and what meaningful service is. Service must respond to community voice. We believe the community knows what the community most needs. We openly communicate with the community and listen to their needs, instead of 'creating' service opportunites to give ourselves a sense of moral superiority. Additionally, we believe that as Lehigh students, we are members of the Bethlehem community. There is a great deal of responsibility involved in this position. If we make a promise to the community, it has to be held. We never make promises we cannot hold and will often go to great extents to ensure no promises fall through.

# My Role

## Blood Drive Coordinator
Lehigh University offers blood drives every few months. I work in a group to promote student signups, organization sponsors, and coordinating times with Miller-Keystone Blood Center.

## Residential Community Coordinator
At Lehigh, we have various themed housing communities. I oversee event coordination of Live.Learn.Serve, the service-based themed housing community for first-year students. In my first year coordinating this housing community, we have focused mostly on communication between the residents, the resident advisors, and ourselves. The residential community members have served at a few different events so far this year and those who are actively engaged appear to be learning a lot about service and the local community.

## Feel Good Friday Coordinator
Most Fridays, the Community Service Office sends a group of students to a local organization to start off their weekend by doing service. As a coordinator of this event, I communicate with local organizations to find who is in need of service at that time. Again, our mindset stresses that service must respond to community voice. We never tell someone else what they need, we always listen and must be open to adapting to community voice.
